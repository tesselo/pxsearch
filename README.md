# PxSearch API
The PxSearch is an API for internal services created to allow search and requests of satellite image data. 

# Objectives
The restructuring of the project in this branch aims to:
- Add to our catalog new datasets, such as sentinel-1 and the landsat collection with level 2 of processing;
- Update our indexing processes using datasets from AWS S3 inventory;
- Restructure the database using STAC specifications(https://stacspec.org/) and SqlAlchemy ORM;
